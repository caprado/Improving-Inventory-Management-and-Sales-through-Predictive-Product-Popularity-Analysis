# Improving Inventory Management and Sales through Predictive Product Popularity Analysis

1.	Project purpose/goals
   
The primary objective of this project is to enhance our inventory management and boost sales by accurately predicting the popularity of our products. By identifying the products that are most sought-after by our customers, we can manage our inventory more effectively, prevent running out of stock or overstocking, and promote the products that our customers are most interested in.

We will employ machine learning and data analytics techniques to sift through large volumes of sales data, allowing us to make accurate predictions. This approach will not only streamline our inventory management but also lead to a more personalized and efficient customer service, as we will be able to anticipate our customers' needs and preferences.

3.	Descriptive method

The descriptive method of this project aims to analyze and describe the existing data related to product popularity among customers to identify patterns and relationships. In addition, this method aims to summarize key features and characteristics of the sales data, allowing us to understand the underlying dynamics and trends in the data. This information will then be used to develop a machine-learning model that can be used to make accurate predictions about product popularity. The descriptive method will involve collecting and preparing the data, exploring the data using various statistical and visualization techniques, and summarizing the findings clearly and concisely.

4.	Predictive/Prescriptive method
   
For this project, we will utilize machine learning algorithms, specifically Collaborative Filtering, to predict which products are most likely to be popular among customers. The algorithm will be trained on sales data to identify patterns and relationships between products and past customer behavior. Finally, the results of the predictions will be used to make informed decisions about inventory management and product promotion. The ultimate goal of this prescriptive approach is to improve sales and reduce the risk of stockouts and overstocking by providing accurate and actionable insights into product popularity.

5. How will the project be executed
   
  - Problem Definition: Clearly define the problem the project aims to solve and the goals that the project aims to achieve.
  - Data Collection: Collect the data needed to train the machine learning model. 
  - Data Exploration and Preparation: Perform exploratory data analysis to understand our data, identify trends or patterns in the formatting, and identify potential challenges such as empty fields.
  - Algorithm Selection: Select the appropriate collaborative filtering approach (Item-based or user-based) for the problem and the data.
  - Model Training and Validation: Train the selected machine learning model using the data and validate it using appropriate evaluation metrics, such as precision, recall, and accuracy, to ensure that it makes accurate and relevant recommendations.
  - Deployment and Maintenance: Deploy the trained model, monitor its performance, and make any necessary updates and optimizations.
  - Project Documentation: Document the entire project process, including the approach, algorithms used, results, and other relevant information as required.
